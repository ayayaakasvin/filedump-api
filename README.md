Petproject, filedump - idea of making some not secure, either feature-rich, just simple system of keeping files in server, so when its necessary to retrieve them via front(https://github.com/ayayaakasvin/filedump-front written in Angular), such requirements was born from some people`s perma request to transfer file from one platform to another, where usually lack of proper tools.

So I guess that`s all. :>
